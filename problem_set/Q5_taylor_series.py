# Taylor series is an important mathematical concept that helps to approximate functions using polynomials

# Here, write a function that uses taylor series to approximate the function f(x) = sin(x) over the domain -2pi to 2pi

# Use numpy and matplotlib to plot your results and display them in the colour blue

# plot the real value of f(x) = sin(x) on the same plot in the colour red
