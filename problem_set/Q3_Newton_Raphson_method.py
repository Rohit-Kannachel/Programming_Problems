# Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of a function

# Use this root finding method to evaluate the square root of 2 to 6 decimal places

# The square root of 2 is 1.414213

true_value = 1.414213

# compare your answer with the true value

# Define the function whose root we are trying to find
