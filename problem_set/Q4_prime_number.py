# A prime number is a number that is divisble only by 1 and itself
# examples are 2,3,5,7
# 4,6,8 are not prime numbers as they are divisble by other numbers 

# Write a function that checks if the following number is prime:

number = 107352437281

# Do not use a naive approach of checking every single number below
# At the least, do not check even numbers
