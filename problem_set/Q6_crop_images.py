# There are about 100 images on a remote server
# they are of an unsuitable size for a ML model, they need to be cropped to 400 x 400

# SSH into the server and copy the folder of images onto your local computer

# Load the images using an image library e.g. PIL

# using numpy/PIL/any resource, crop the images into the required size

# save these cropped images into a new folder called "Cropped Images"

# use SSH to copy the new folder back into the server
